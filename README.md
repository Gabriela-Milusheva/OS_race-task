Write a shell script that produces a file of sequential numbers by reading the last number 
in the file, adding 1 to it, and then appending to the file. Run one instance of the script 
in the background and one in the foreground, each accessing the same file. 
 - How long does it take before a race condition manifests itself? 
 - What is the critical section? 
 - Modify the script to prevent the race.  
   (Hint: use In file file.lock to lock the data file).
